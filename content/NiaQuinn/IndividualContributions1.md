# Welcome back, here's what you've missed!

Just wanted to add some notes on the things that I was able to contribute to this phase of the project. In relation to the project ideation, I along with my teammates were able to collaborate on the discussion in relation to the project. There was a stark evolution from a project dedicated to determining the success of restaurants given specifed criteria to a project associated with assiting various types of users to understand the general sentiment of different countries.

After assisting in this discussion regarding themes, I also contributed to the final deliverable by creating one of the user personas and editing the markdown file that would eventually become the final team blog post. Part of the difficulty was refining all of the ideas we had in relation to the topic, the issue was mostly regarding the access to different data sets we could find.

From there, I created the user persona specifically regarding the PR specialist Katerina. This allowed us to delve into the different users that could potentially benefit from the application and target project.
