### Hey there, this is Nia. 

I'm a computer science and mathematics major at Northeastern University out of Boston, MA. Outside of school, I am an active member of NEU's Club Running team, love to cook, travel, listen to all sorts of music, and explore different cuisines!

##### Super excited to have you here, get ready to check out XXX project idea!
