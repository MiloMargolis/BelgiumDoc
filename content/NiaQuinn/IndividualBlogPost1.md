A few days of Python review, data-cleaning crash courses, and a brush-up on statistics after touching down in Belgium, all 28 of us, 26 students and 2 professors, had the opportunity to take a quick trip next door to Brussels where we were about to listen to three knowledgeable speakers from the EEAS for short, or European External Action Service for long.

The first speaker discussed the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity in a world revolutionized by artificial intelligence with state, non-state, and state-nexxus groups acting as major sources of threat. These threats mostly came in the form of traditional strategies like ransomware and Denial of Service attacks. Such vulnerabilities can be found through bugs in technology, the processes in which policy is moved (or not) forward, and the people executing the work themselves. 

Moving forward that afternoon, the third speaker explored the increase of false information and misinformation (FIMI) from state actors across many channels. Walking through an example, the speaker relayed to us the reach that a Russian YouTube video discussing Ukrainian weakness in war had as other media sources began picking it up as the story grew in popularity. Through this layered example, it became clear that as misinformation spreads from malicious state actors, people are more likely to believe the misinformation because it is more prevalent, starting this vicious cycle. 

The day afterward, we bused out to NATO where, again, all 28 of us were granted the chance to listen to technically minded speakers.

Of the three speakers present, the second and third speakers stood out for their ability to describe NATO’s astute ability to capitalize on the world’s rapidly changing technology. Touching more on concrete examples of the ways that social media plays in combating misinformation on social media, the second speaker relayed personal anecdotes of past girlfriends falling victim to state accounts acting as radicalized users and how misinformation leads to distrust in previously trusted experts. 

Following this speaker, we were introduced to a speaker who discussed how harnessing emerging technologies in the 32 NATO member states faces lots of bureaucratic difficulties with the lack of technical understanding of AI, Quantum Computing, and other technologies of the sort. This becomes evident because of the pace at which NATO updates and polishes policy and status on the use of AI for state use, which hasn’t been updated over the past 2 years. 

Upon further reflection, many of the themes discussed in dialogue with the speakers, the necessity for education on technological literacy has become more paramount than ever before as it will do everything from teaching younger generations to filter their media sources to briefing older generations on the reality of technology and the steps they can take to use it more effectively as a tool.
