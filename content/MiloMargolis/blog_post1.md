During our group's initial tour around the city of Leuven, our tour guide shared a comical historical anecdote about the city. During World War II, as Leuven soldiers prepared for the impending German invasion, the town members took proactive measures by building a defensive wall around their city. During one particularly cold winter night, Belgian soldiers drank beer while stationed in their towers in order to gain warmth. Suddenly, one soldier noticed movement in the forest beyond the Leuven wall. Believing that this movement was the incoming attack of German soldiers, the guards launched arrows into the darkness. After a few minutes of fire, the Lueven soldiers heard nothing but silence from the trees, and began to celebrate, believing that they had killed all of the German solidres. The Lueven soldiers continued to drink long into the night and fell asleep after the celebrations faded. However, when the sun rose the next day, the Lueven soldiers discovered that instead of killing Germans, they had slaughtered a field of cows. This incident, although comical, shed light on the tension of World War II in Belgium, where the citizens were not only ready for war, but also living on very limited natural resources. 

Beyond the tour guideâ€™s anecdote, I also learned that Lueven experienced real tragedy during the World War tour, as German troops did eventually occupy Leuven for some time. During this time, there were a variety of civilian casualties and the KU Leuven Library ended up being destroyed in 1940 by a fire. However, despite these devastations, Leuven managed to rebuild and preserve its rich cultural heritage. The efforts to restore the town, library, and maintain cultural sites continues to highlight the city's commitment to preserving its history.
