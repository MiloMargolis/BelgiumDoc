Discussion/description of individual contributions to Phase 4 results

### Personal Contributions

In terms of my contributions to the final project, I felt proud of both the individual software I wrote as well as my ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively. I dedicated time to building our initial project idea, drafting a DDL, ER diagrams, and an in-depth wireframe (all of which I have referred to in my previous blog posts). For stage four, I dedicated the majority of my time to building app pages and routes, specifically for Anton’s persona. I built Anton’s four pages and routes consisting of a profile view, an add article page, a view article page, and a random forest ML model page. I also wrote code and debugged heavily for Monika’s page and Katerina’s page. I spent time building our DDL and debugging with Paolo (because our DDL gave us the most trouble with errors). In terms of my team efforts, I felt proud of my ability to help merge team ideas and infrastructure. I frequently was the member who made the call to communicate to our team members when I felt like we were not understanding what the other members were doing and/or working on. I also frequently helped the team plan and coordinate where we would focus our individual efforts in a way that would integrate feasibly.

### Challenges and Enjoyable Moments

Quite honestly, I had a blast with this project. I’ve never built any sort of web app, and I have pretty limited experience with frontend work, so this project was a ton of learning and growing for me. I found the routes to be the most challenging aspect of this project. Writing individual code files feels straightforward, but I remember feeling constantly confused about the communication levels between frontend, database, API, and backend. However, I now feel like I have a strong understanding of routes, and a strong understanding of the way in which our codebase communicated across its various sections. My favorite part of this project was also the most challenging part: the routes. I felt really solid about my SQL and database knowledge, so my favorite part of this project was learning how to communicate between user in-app interactions and our database.

### Resume
World News Web-App:
Created a dynamic web application using Streamlit, Docker, and Python for sentiment analysis of global news. Designed a SQL database to manage articles, enabling users to view, post, and analyze news. Integrated a Random Forest ML model to predict the country of origin for each article.
