Discussion/description of individual contributions to Phase II results
# Overview
This week, I spent the majority of my time for phase two working in exclaidraw. While creating the localized ER
diagrams, the main issue we encountered was that our 3 user entiities were too simular. In order to troubleshoot this, 
we changed the way each user entity intereacted with the app, so that each use case was unique. User 1 selected a variety
of key filters on the app, user two interacted with the likes, saves, and share features, and user 3 interacted with the user
preferences feature in settings. Combining the three ER diagrams into a global ER diagram felt straightforward, and I beleive my drawing effectively conveyed our table relations. I then shifted my focus to creating the Wireframe POC. Creating the wireframe was very fun because I basically got to design the UI/UX draft model from scratch. The main challenge with this process was drafting the wireframe in a way that was feasable with our global ER diagram. Lastly, I reviewed Paolo's draft of the SQL DDL, which I thought looked solid in relation to our diagrams. Looking forward for phase three! 


# Personal Work Addendum for Week #2
- I collaborated to create the local ER diagrams for 3 user attributes (teamwork)
- I combined the local ER diagrams to make a more detailed Global ER diagram (individual)
- I drew the Wireframe POC for our app UI (individual)
- I reviewed the SQL DDL that Paolo drafted (teamwork)
- I collaborated on the team's blog post (teamwork)
