# Phase 3 Contributions

My contributions to this phase included working on 7 of the REST API routes, and building up some of the navbar features.
I designed the routes for the social blueprint including the `POST` and `DELETE` routes for the `likes`, `shared`, and `saves` tables.
I also worked on some of the front end, specifically related to the navbar, and the `About.py` and `Home.py` pages. Other smaller 
contributions included just debugging API route errors and making sure that pages actually linked together in a way that made sense
and looked seemless.

# Phase 3 Troubles

I had lots of difficulties in this phase, and many were related to beginning to work on this part of the project pretty late.
I was sick the night the previous phase was due, so I worked in a silo, detached from the rest of the team, and that meant that
some of the goals and ideas had changed. This made it harder for me to begin work on this phase as I had to discuss with the DS 
side of my team for some time and understand how some decisions had affected our project. I also had difficulties specifically in
writing some of the method routes as I wasn't sure what we actually needed the front end to see, and how that would be connected
with the middleware that is Flask.

I believe the biggest issue I encountered was status code 500 being returned from most of my http requests to the Flask API. I was
able to figure out issues related to the containers not being properly connected, as well as getting the database to mount properly
but the error code 500 was just a thorn that wouldn't go away.

# Reflection

Looking back on what made this phase so difficult, I'm dedicated to start working on the next phase as early as tomorrow, June 6th,
and continue working on it at a decent pace the whole week. I think this'll make the workload way more manageable and make the
workload able to be better split.
