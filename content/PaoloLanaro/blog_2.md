## Ambitious Adventures

Today, Sunday May 19th, we didn't have any class. That meant that a good group of us students thought to travel around Belgium and sight see!

My group of roommates and I (Michael, Aahil, and Andy) had decided to visit Bruges yesterday night, and we woke up at 7:30 in order to have some ICL sponsored dinner before heading out for the day. We caught the 9:21 train from Leuven to Bruges and when we got there it felt like we travelled to old times. 

The first thing we noticed when we got off the train was the constant ringing of the bell tower. This bell tower was the center of the old capital of Beligum so we slowly but surely made our way there. There were so many tourists in the town center. So many. And we just added more to it.

We quickly visited a small medival looking area with brick towers and buildings and a museum that we believe contained cadavers (but we didn't want to enter and find out).
After leaving through a narrow alleyway, and through an arched entrance, we continued on to the bell tower. When we got to the bell tower we realized it cost money, and that you had to book times in order to visit the top (so we ended up skipping it as the broke college students we are in our hearts).

We travelled to the provincial palace (or provincial court) and visited a lavish room with beautiful art pane windows.
