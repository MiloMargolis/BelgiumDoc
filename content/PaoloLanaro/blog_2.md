## Ambitious Adventures

Sunday May 19th, we didn't have any class. That meant that a good group of us students thought to travel around Belgium and sight see!

My group of roommates and I (Michael, Aahil, and Andy) had decided to visit Bruges on Saturday night, and we woke up at 7:30 in order to have some ICL sponsored breakfast before heading out for the day. We caught the 9:21 train from Leuven to Bruges and when we got there it felt like we travelled to a distant past. 

The first thing we noticed when we got off the train was the constant ringing of the bell tower. This bell tower was the center of the old capital of Beligum so we slowly but surely made our way there. There were so many tourists in the town center. So many. And we just added more to the already massive crowd.

We quickly visited a small medival looking area with brick towers and buildings and a museum that we believe contained cadavers (but we didn't want to enter and find out).
After leaving through a narrow alleyway, and an arched entrance, we continued trudging towards the bell tower. When we got to the bell tower we realized it cost money to reach the top of the tower. Another issue presented itself in the form that we had to book a time to actually visit the tower anyway. These factors in mind, we ended up skipping this part of Bruges.

When we were done at the bell tower we meandered over to the provincial palace (or provincial court) right down the road. Here we found beautiful stained glass art and several portraits of governers of the province of West Flanders. After spending some time at the provincial palace we got back out and started adventuring through the city. We followed a path recommended by a book about visiting Brussels my mom gifted me for my birthday.
