## Ambitious Adventures

Sunday May 19th, we didn't have any class. That meant that a good group of us students thought to travel around Belgium and sight see!

My group of roommates and I (Michael, Aahil, and Andy) had decided to visit Bruges on Saturday night, and we woke up at 7:30 in order to have some ICL sponsored breakfast 
before heading out for the day. We caught the 9:21 train from Leuven to Bruges and when we got there it felt like we travelled to a distant past. 

The first thing we noticed when we got off the train was the constant ringing of the bell tower. This bell tower was the center of the old 'capital' of Belgium so we 
slowly but surely made our way there. There were so many tourists in the town center. So many. And we just added more to the already massive crowd.

We quickly visited a small medival looking area with brick towers and buildings and a museum that we believe contained cadavers (but we didn't want to enter and find out).
After leaving through a narrow alleyway, and an arched entrance, we continued trudging towards the bell tower. When we got to the bell tower we realized it cost money to 
reach the top of the tower. Another issue presented itself in the form that we had to book a time to actually visit the tower anyway. These factors in mind, we ended up 
skipping this part of Bruges.

When we were done at the bell tower we meandered over to the provincial palace (or provincial court) right down the road. Here we found beautiful stained glass art and 
several portraits of governers of the province of West Flanders. After spending some time at the provincial palace we got back out and started adventuring through the city. 
We followed a path recommended by a book about visiting Brussels my mom gifted me for my birthday. 

We ended up at a beautiful meadow with an old windmill and spent about an hour there. After everyone met up at this meadow, and we spent some time there, we slowly 
headed back to the city center in order to get lunch.

What's for lunch? "The Olive Street Food" with some of the most tasty pork I've had, pita that tasted like pita, and some mixed greens! The sun beamed down on us for the 30
minutes that our lunch took to down. When we were all done there was some debate about what to do next with Michael Bobby and I deciding to visit the torture museum. 

I won't go into detail about this museum, but there was some very gruesome and downright evil contraptions. I don't understand how any human could subject another to 
some of the forms of torture we saw, but I guess humans are still animals in the end. While in the smelly cellar that was the tortute museum, we recieved a message 
from the rest of the group informing us that there was one train an hour to Blankenberge. 

Blankenberge, a city which sits on the North Sea, was beautiful. The city has a long boardwalk which follows the coastline, and it's less than 127km from the coast of
England. We only spent around an hour in Blankenberge as there's only one train out of the Blankenberge train station every hour. During our stay, I got to touch the 
North Sea for the first time in my life, and take a couple pretty pictures of the sea.

We ended up leaving Blankenberge and stopping at Ghent to spend some time and eat dinner in this ancient city. When we got to Ghent we walked to the Citadelpark, which
as you may have guessed, was the site of a former citadel. While there we got to see some beautiful ponds and water structures as well as what seemed to be bronze and
copper statues. We spent around half an hour there before making the 30 minute hike to the city center of Ghent (quite far from the "Ghent" train station).
