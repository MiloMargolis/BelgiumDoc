## Fascinating Findings

Hello, and welcome to my first blog post!
I wanted to take this time to detail my first few days in Belgium, and first time studying abroad.
I've found that studying abroad (or on a Northeastern Dialogue of Civilizations) is a very very different experience from studying "back home", or in the U.S. 

First of all, of the two lectures we've had, they've both been way more fast paced than even the weeks leading up to any final in a "normal" semester.
The experience is just... different, from the not-quite-classroom environment, to the excursions we've done in the past two days. 
	A normal semester would never include excursions to the European External Action Service (EEAS) or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Yes, the NATO you're thinking of.
	Besides just going to these places, I've learned a lot about many different aspects of international government and policy from our time with speakers at each of these locations, as well as with Serge Stroobants, director of Europe & MENA at the Institute for Economics and Peace.

During our first two classes I learned a lot about Docker, SQL, and SQL. In SQL I've learnt a lot about some basic keywords in SQL and how to work with example data sets. `SELECT <table attributes>`, `FROM <table-name>` `JOIN <table-name> ON <condition>`, `WHERE <condition list>`,  `GROUP BY <attribute-list>`, `HAVING <group-conditions>`, `ORDER BY <column [ASC|DESC], [...]>` are all SQL keywords I've learnt in the past few *days*, and I don't think I'd have been able to learn so much so quickly at home, or during another summer semester. 

Thinking about data and the application of computer and data science in an international setting is an eye-opening and great experience. This, and the mix of great food in Leuven, has made my team think about pursuing a possible project idea in predicting the estimated success of a restaurant based on demographical, geographical, and social indicators. 

I'm wrapping this blog up now, and I know it's kind of an abrupt end, but I will be adding more in the coming days!

## Addendum May 21 2024 (Personal work)

This section will include my personal contributions to phase 1 of the project. I was able to help with the setup of Hugo and the website in general. This included fixing an issue in which we were running a github action that was unrelated to the original repo. Past just generally helping with the website setup, I also worked on Persona 3 (Monika) for the PoC. Aside from persona 3 (Monika) and working on the website setup with the rest of the team, I was just generally part of team discussions as there truly is no "I" in "team".
