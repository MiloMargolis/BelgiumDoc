# Phase 4 is done!

## My contributions to the final project
I worked on setting up lots of the routes related to the API layer. This including actually creating the routes, as well as linking them up
with the front end pages that they would be called from. I had to create and edit pages for Katerina and Monika so that the routes could be
called from a nice looking front end. Besides just the routes and pages, I think my main contribution to the project overall this phase was
explaining how routes work and the communication between each layer of abstraction to my groupmates. I did this by drawing a couple images
that made it easier to visualize how the layers were communicated with each other (see below for a similar image). Another big contribution
was simply helping the rest of my team with any Docker or Git related issues they may have had during the development process of Diplomatic
Data. I want to preface this by saying that I am not a Git guru or a Docker demon, however, in most cases I was able to help them debug any
issues they may have had: get docker images back up and running, resolve any merge conflicts, or help merge branches into main.

## Most challenging aspects
I think the most challenging aspect for this project is the same as any other project, cross functional team communication. The abstraction
that started at the beginning of this project, with the DS students working on the models, and the CS persisted throughout some of the project
and made certain issues keep growing as time went on. I don't blame this on anyone except myself, as if we had been able to communicate more
effectively and explain our ideas in a more clear way, I think the DS students would have had an easier time implementing their models, and
our lives would have been mader easier during the final phases of this project. Another challenging aspect of this project I found was that
I started off with the frontend and API layer before I had a true grasp on the concept of communication between these layers so it took me
a day or two to understand that it almost mirrors a MVC design pattern (albeit in a fairly abstract way). 

## Most rewarding aspects

I think the most rewarding parts of this project have also been those that made this project difficult; working in a team. Working in a team
has taught me valuable lessons (such as those mentioned above), as well as opened my eyes to a different way of thinking. I also know that
without the rest of my team working on so many different aspects of the project, there is a 0% chance I would have been able to get something 
even similar to our final project done within the time frame we built the app in. Another aspect about the project, and the dialogue as a whole,
that I found super rewarding was the ability to be able to learn "out of my comfort zone", and in a group of likeminded and very smart peers.
What I mean by this is that I would never been able to learn SQL (although I'm sure I've barely scratched the surface), Flask, and Streamlit
in just 4 weeks had it not been truly fun for me to do so. This is both spurred on by the project being something tangible, and, again, being
surrounded by smart, funny, and kind people.
