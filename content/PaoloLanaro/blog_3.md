# Phase 2

My contribution to phase 2 of the project has been working on the ER diagrams, and the SQL DDL. 
As a team, we've discussed many aspects of the project such as what we can and can't build linear regression models on (specifically when it comes to text),
simple ideas for features, and the structure and normalization of the database schema. I specifically worked on the ER diagrams for the Monika and Anton 
archetypes, and worked on building the DDL for all the tables. Milo and I worked on the overall DDL, with me taking the setup of most of the tables, and Milo
making sure everything made sense and worked.
