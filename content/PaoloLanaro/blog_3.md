# Phase 2

My contribution to phase 2 of the project has been working on the ER diagrams, and the SQL DDL. 
As a team, we've discussed many aspects of the project such as what we can and can't build linear regression models on (specifically when it comes to text),
simple ideas for features, and the structure and normalization of the database schema. I specifically worked on the ER diagrams for the Monika and Anton 
archetypes, and worked on building the DDL for all the tables. Milo and I worked on the overall DDL, with me taking the setup of most of the tables, and Milo
making sure everything made sense and worked.

Some challenges I've found while working on this project so far have been generally finding good time for everyone in my team to meet up. There have been
nights when we've only worked on the project for our rooms, and other nights where we haven't been able to work on the project at all, and that meant that 
nearing the due date for this phase, we had to scramble to finish it. Another obstacle in our way was that on the due date for the phase, we realized we 
hadn't been truthfully fitting our ER diagrams to our personas so we had to rebuild those diagrams.

On a different note, I've really been enjoying Belgium these past few weeks! It has been so much fun to go to Bruges (of which there has been a blog post in the 
works for almost a week), and other cities, and get to meet so many different people. Belgium seems to be such a melting point for cultures which makes everything 
just so awesome! There was an awesome Leuven street market on Saturday the 25th of May which included food stands from Italian, Japanese, and Hong Kong cuisines 
to name a few. I've been enjoying my time on this Dialogue and I hope to keep that going!
