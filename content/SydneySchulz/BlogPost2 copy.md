### Phase 3 contributions

For phase 3 of the project one of the biggest challenges that we faced was understanding and addressing the limitations of our dataset. When we attempted to grab more data from more countries using the API, we found that it was no longer possible. Nia and I attempted to work around the limitations by setting up new accounts and placing limits on what was pulled but the API was consistently preventing us from collecting data that could be easily used. 

As a result, we had to accept that the linear regression model that we made in the last phase and any future model would be imperfect. I implemented the Random Forest Classifier. When implementing it, these problems were clear. Ideally, I would have liked to have not just more data in general but also more features to input into the classifier so that it could have a chance at being useful. 

Many more of the challenges that we faced when implementing the machine learning algorithms and with the data I discussed in the blog post as well.


### Dialogue Recap

This past weekend we were able to spend 3 nights in Luxembourg. I thought it was a very interesting city. To be perfectly honest, before this dialogue I thought Luxembourg and Liechtenstein were the same place but Luxembourg really surprised me. The city and all the architecture and nature around were incredibly beautiful and I loved being able to on a long walk in between the gorges and see the city above me. We were able to go outside the city in countryside as well which was also beautiful. Despite this, I do think that Leuven is my favorite city as the culture of students, size of the city, and accessibility to other major Belgium cities is ideal.
