Friday May 17th marks the fifth day of the 2024 Leuven dialogue. Although the program has so far only been the equivalent length of a syllabus week in the regular semester, we have been able to accomplish a surprising amount. While the combination of frequent travel, jetlag, long class days, and taking advantage of the local culture has been somewhat tiring, it has already been incredibly rewarding. 
When I attempted to explain the program to my friends and family before I left, I often left them with more questions than answers as I was unsure what to expect myself. I knew I would be taking two classes, living in Belgium and I would be staying in what I originally thought was a convent. I was unsure how the international politics aspect would be incorporated especially because the program ran under such a short time period. 

On Wednesday, we got our first taste of international policy incorporation into the program when Serge Stroobants of the Institute for Economics and Peace spoke. After this session and the others that have followed, I have started to build a rudimentary understanding of the current state of economic policy, how different organizations and governmental bodies hold different priorities and perspectives, and how my own major and interests can be significant.

Two of the sessions that I felt pushed these insights were the speakers and conversations that discussed mis/disinformation and foreign information manipulation. I found it incredibly interesting how the two speakers both viewed the push of disinformation as an additional form of warfare on the minds of people. It was both fascinating and terrifying to learn how susceptible all people are to this manipulation and how the threat is growing. While I have learned about misinformation and the distrust of mainstream media in my journalism classes, hearing about the issues from a policy and warfare lens showed me just how much is at stake.

### Phase 1 contributions

For phase 1, along with my teammates, I did extensive research for possible project ideas by searching through datasets and finding potential API's. After we finalized a project idea and confirmed that the API could work, I contributed to phase 1 by writing the project description and writing and breaking down the major questions.
