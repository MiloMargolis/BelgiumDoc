### Phase 2 contributions

One of the biggest challenges of implementing phase 2 was finding the balance of what we would like to implement and what we realistically could implement based on our own knowledge and the timeline of the project. As a result, a lot of our time was spend cleaning the data by not only figuring out how to isolate queries and make the data useable, but by constantly having discussions and playing around with models to see what actually could be feasable. The cleaning and ideation was performed by Nia and I. Nia performed a lot of the heavy lifting of exploring and isolating the necessary information from the HTML extracted from API and I assisted with creating sample data to assist with cleaning and performed sample ML models during that time to figure out what may be feasable for the project. After the data was fully cleaned and we had a useable CSV file, I performed the data exploration and initial analysis. I created sample visualizations and found some simple statistics to see what some of the trends were with the data. After Nia performed the linear regression models, we all collaborated to write the group blog post.


### Dialogue Recap

Over the past week on the dialogue we have had the opportunity to explore 3 new cities, talk to interesting people in government, the private sector, and NGO's. Despite these experiences being culturally and intellectually enriching, my favorite experience so far has been the pastry chef. As a lover of sweet treats and especially chocolate, it was really cool to go behind the scenes and see how the sausage gets made. While I don't think that being a pastry chef is in my future, it was a lot of fun to play pretend for the day.
