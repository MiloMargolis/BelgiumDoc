# Overview (Phase 1 Deliverable below)

#### We started out this "checkpoint" by thinking about apps that we would be interested in, especially some app idea that would be useful during our studies abroad.

### Initial Thoughts

The app idea we started to think about was an app that resembled 'Google Maps' or 'Yelp' in terms of getting good food recommendations for travellers. The very obvious problem with this idea is that both of those apps already exist. Taking this idea and combining it with that of small businesses, we thought about making an app that would predict the success of a restaurant in a city or general area. This app would combine Google Maps (Yelp, etc.) data of nearby restaurants including reviews, comments (with sentiment analysis), and other data points for the prediction. As we worked with this idea more (and talked to both Dr. Fontenot, and Dr. Gerber), we realized that this still wasn't answering the main project question, "'change someone's world'". Sure, we were changing the world of some small business owners with their future decisions, but it didn't relate to international politics at large. This was the start to our second phase, the slightly delirious brainstorming eve of the 21st.

### Shifting Topics

We began thinking about globalizing the very general concept of "food" (again, after the insight of Dr. Fontenot and Dr. Gerber). Food insecurity and scarcity was a natural choice as it affect people all over the world every day. As we started discussing this topic and researching databanks and API's we got led into the topics of education and lack thereof. This eventually led us to what we'll be planning our project around, the general politics and sentiment towards people of some origin when they go travelling.
