This blog serves as a record for the project we created called Diplomatic Data. Below is the
project description for DIplomatic Data.

This project was created over the course of Northeastern University's Summer 2024 Dialouge 
of Civilizations to Leuven, Belgium focused on the intersection of software development and 
AI in the context of international policy and regulation. Targeted at understanding the 
relationships between various news sources and their influences on global sentiments, this 
app highlights how different users may be able to analyze countries of interests. They can 
predict sentiment scores of articles, track articles, and more! We invite you to explore 
and find how the Diplomatic Data team can help serve your purposes.
