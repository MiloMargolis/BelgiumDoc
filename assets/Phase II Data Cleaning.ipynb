      "('news', [NewsArticle(id=49692380, title='Zelensky claims significant gains in northeastern Ukraine as key city retaken', text='In a nightly address Thursday, Zelensky claimed the country\\'s military had retaken more than 1,000 square kilometers of territory since the beginning of the month. Oleksii Hromov, the deputy head of the main operations directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said Ukrainian forces were able to advance 50 kilometers (about 31 miles) in the Kharkiv region and liberate \"more than 20 settlements.\" Through geolocation and the statements of the Ukrainian military, independent analysts and Russian military bloggers, it\\'s estimated that Ukrainian forces have taken well over 400 square kilometers of territory this week in the Kharkiv region. Meanwhile, some Russian troops in the Kharkiv region have deserted and abandoned their uniforms due to Russia\\'s \"significant losses,\" the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said, adding that the soldiers are hoping to blend in while wearing civilian clothing. \"Personnel of the occupying forces in civilian clothes resort to desertion and try to return to the territory of the Russian Federation,\" the General Staff said in a situational update Friday, claiming that 15 such cases had been observed. The Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that the Russian 202nd Motorized Rifle Regiment, \"located in the Kharkiv region, withdrew from their positions and moved to the nearest forest. The unit was left without commanders and communications.\" The Directorate claimed that Russian soldiers were \"calling to relatives with requests to contact the command and find out where they should go next. Some of them ask their wives to contact the hotlines of the Ministry of Defense of Russia and the Red Cross with the demand to remove them from the territory of Ukraine.\" It provided no evidence for the assertion. Counteroffensives on two fronts While the southern front, in Kherson region, looks set to be one of the main theaters of conflict as the war heads towards winter, a new Ukrainian push in Kharkiv could stretch Russian forces across two disparate locations. In recent weeks, Russia redeployed some forces to the south to bolster its ranks ahead of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson region, according to Ukrainian officials and footage of equipment moving through Crimea geolocated by CNN.

Russian forces are struggling to make advances in the Donetsk region, despite Ukrainian casualties. Ukrainian army resists Russian advances After Russian forces captured the last city in Luhansk region still in Ukrainian hands -- Lysychansk -- they have stepped up the bombardment of towns and cities in the neighboring Donetsk region. The Russian military has kept up a persistent barrage of artillery and missile strikes across the region for several weeks. The Kremlin says the goal of what it calls the \"special military operation\" is to take control of both Luhansk and Donetsk. About 45% of Donetsk -- a region of heavy industry interspersed with farmland -- is still held by the Ukrainians. But they are under pressure from three directions -- east, north and south. Russian forces are also firing at Ukrainian positions south of the town of Bakhmut, according to the General Staff, including missile and air strikes, as well as artillery. Three missiles hit the Toretsk community but there was no information about casualties, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of Donetsk region military administration. In the city of Kostiantynivka, the Russians had shelled the medical college, Kyrylenko added. He also urged civilians in the area to evacuate. For their part, the Russian armed forces have claimed \"high-precision attacks\" that \"resulted in the elimination of 115th Mechanised Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) that had operated towards Siversk.\" The area around Siversk has been heavily contested in the last two weeks, but Ukrainian forces appear to be holding out. Further north the city of Kharkiv has again been hit by missiles, Ukrainian officials say. Two missiles hit a five-storey industrial building and caught fire, Oleh Syniehubov, Head of Kharkiv region military administration said. \\'Russia is struggling\\' As the war in Ukraine approaches five months and both armies suffer heavy losses, western officials say Ukraine \"absolutely\" believes it will regain territory from Russia and win the war. \"They are absolutely clear that they plan to restore the whole of their territory in terms of Ukraine, and they see a Russia that is struggling, a Russia that we assess has lost more than 30% of its land combat effectiveness,\" UK Chief of the Defense Staff Admiral Tony Radakin told the BBC Sunday. \"What that actually means is 50,000 Russian soldiers that have either died or been injured in this conflict, nearly 1,700 Russian tanks destroyed, nearly 4,000 armored fighting vehicles that belong to Russia (were) destroyed. Boris Johnson was Kyiv\\'s darling. Now that he\\'s leaving, Ukraine fears what\\'s next \"And what you\\'re seeing is a Russia, if we focus on the Donbas, that is less than 10% of the territory of Ukraine and we are approaching 150 days, and Russia is struggling to take that territory, and it is struggling because of the courage and determination of the Ukrainian armed forces. \"Russia started this invasion with the ambition to take the whole of Ukraine, Russia had the ambition to take the cities in the first 30 days, Russia had the ambition to create fractures and to apply pressure to NATO, this is Russia as a challenge to the world order, Russia is failing in all of those ambitions, Russia is a more diminished nation than it was at the beginning of February,\" Radakin added.

During Nitzan\\'s visit to Ukraine last month, she decribed Mariupol\\'s hygienic situation as a \"a huge hazard.\" Andrushchenko said natural water sources in the city are decreasing as the warmer months arrive. He said Russian evacuations from the city had stopped, and that leaving the city is no longer possible. \"You can enter the city with a residence permit in Mariupol. But this is a one-way ticket, because you cannot leave. \"Of all the possible scenarios to fight the epidemic, in our opinion, Russia has chosen, as always, the most cynical one -- just to close the people in the city and leave everything as it is: Whoever survives, survives,\" he said. The deputy mayor of Mariupol, Serhiy Orlov, who is also not in the city, said Tuesday that he believes around 150,000 people remain out of a pre-invasion population of more than 400,000, and a further 30,000 to 40,000 in surrounding suburbs. Orlov claimed that Russian had taken large amounts of medical equipment from Mariupol to the separatist city of Donetsk. Why Russia is being accused of using food as a weapon of war Mariupol has witnessed some of the heaviest fighting of the invasion. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater. Before falling under Russian control, the city was a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as it sustained relentless attacks. Conditions deterioriated rapidly over the course of the war, with food and water dwindling in the city. The battle for the city ended in May when Russian forces ended the final holdout of Ukrainian resistance in the Azovstal steel plant. Ukraine last suffered a major cholera epidemic in 1995 and has experienced minor outbreaks since, \"especially around the Azov sea coast -- which includes Mariupol,\" according to the British intelligence report. \"Medical services in Mariupol are likely already near collapse: a major cholera outbreak in Mariupol will exacerbate this further.\"', summary='Ukraine\\'s southern city of Mariupol, now fully under Russian control, is at risk of a cholera outbreak, according to a British intelligence report published Friday, echoing concerns of Ukrainian officials as Russia struggles to provide basic public services to civilian populations in areas it has occupied.<div class=\"feedflare\">\\n<a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=vRgIGv5FeF8:Fm8bTZy7c4Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=vRgIGv5FeF8:Fm8bTZy7c4Q:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=vRgIGv5FeF8:Fm8bTZy7c4Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?i=vRgIGv5FeF8:Fm8bTZy7c4Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=vRgIGv5FeF8:Fm8bTZy7c4Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http:', url='https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/10/europe/ukraine-mariupol-potential-cholera-outbreak-intl/index.html', image='https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220610142229-ukraine-mariupol-cholera-super-tease.jpg', publish_date='2022-06-10 22:52:07', author='Mick Krever', language='en', source_country='us', sentiment=-0.049), NewsArticle(id=23895132, title=\"It's nearly three months since Russia invaded Ukraine. Here's where things stand\", text='Donbas After weeks of intense fighting, Ukraine\\'s eastern Donbas region is \"completely destroyed,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday. He accused Russia of a \"deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible\" after a village in Chernihiv was hit with missiles, leaving many dead. Officials in the region say the front line is being shelled \"day and night,\" with Russian forces attempting to break through Ukrainian lines. A NATO military official told CNN Wednesday that the alliance expects something of a stalemate over the next few weeks. But the official said NATO believes momentum has shifted significantly in favor of Ukraine and the debate within NATO circles is now over whether it is possible for Kyiv to retake Crimea and the Donbas territories seized by Russia and Russian-backed separatists, respectively, in 2014. Kharkiv Ukrainian forces have beaten back Russia\\'s assaults in Ukraine\\'s second city of Kharkiv, and advanced toward the border in several places north and east of the city. Ukrainian officials said last week they were liberating villages on the outskirts of the city. Their advances led to the symbolic and embarrassing expulsion of the Kremlin\\'s forces back to their own border while posing the strategic threat of cutting Russia\\'s supply lines into Ukraine and its forces further south in Donbas. Anastasia Paraskevova recently returned to her home in Kharkiv for the first time since fleeing the city two months ago. It had been under constant bombardment since then, until Russian forces were repelled. Paraskevova said overall the experience was good. \"The city was much more alive. People were walking the streets. And some shops were working. It felt like some life was back, much better than it was when I was here in March.\" Kherson Every day, hundreds, or even thousands, of people are trying to flee the Russian-occupied region of Kherson in southern Ukraine. The city has been under Russian control since early in the invasion. Ukrainians are leaving for many reasons: to avoid being detained or to escape the heavy-handed actions of Russian forces, or because of the chronic shortages of medicine and other basics in Kherson, which fell under Russian control soon after the invasion. Last week, a convoy of about 1,000 vehicles tried to leave Kherson. The Russians ultimately let the convoy move in batches -- but only after holding it in one place for most of the day. Mariupol Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, finally fell to Russian forces after weeks of relentless bombardment. The city was the scene of some of the most intense fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater where hundreds of civilians had sought refuge from the violence. Mariupol became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as its defenders held out at Azovstal, a sprawling steelworks plant where as many as 1,000 civilians had taken shelter at one point, with stocks of food and water dwindling. Ukraine\\'s military announced late Monday that its forces had completed their \"combat mission\" at Azovstal, effectively ceding the city to Russian forces. On Friday, Ukraine ordered its forces to stop defending the plant. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered at Azovstal. CNN cannot independently verify that figure. With the city now almost fully under Russian control, there is concern that evidence of any potential war crimes -- like those allegedly committed in Bucha and Borodianka -- could be lost or destroyed.

An investigation by The New York Times alleged that Russian paratroopers carried out summary executions of at least eight Ukrainian men in Bucha on March 4. Evidence of mass graves and civilian executions in the towns of Bucha and Borodianka has continued to emerge since early April, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region. Images of bodies lying strewn the streets of Bucha have sparked international condemnation and fueled calls for an investigation into potential Russian war crimes. CNN visited the scene of mass graves in Bucha in April after Russian forces had withdrawn, revealing the horrors of their occupation to the world. Correspondent Fred Pleitgen was among the first to reach a mass grave that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling.

A 21-year-old Russian soldier named Vadim Shishimarin pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed 62-year-old man. The trial\\'s first day was so packed with journalists that authorities in Kyiv were forced to move to bigger venue. It has since produced several dramatic moments, including a confrontation between the soldier and the victim\\'s widow and testimony from Shishimarin himself. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, attends a court hearing on Wednesday. Speaking Friday, Shishimarin acknowledged he was responsible for the killing but was \"sorry and sincerely repents.\" \"I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn\\'t want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,\" he said. Shishimarin\\'s lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, argued that while his client was guilty of killing, it was not murder. \"Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,\" Ovsyannikov said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Russia has no details about Shishimarin\\'s case and it considers the charges \"unacceptable,\" \"outrageous\" and \"staged.\" JUST WATCHEDWidow confronts Russian soldier who killed husbandReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWidow confronts Russian soldier who killed husband 01:50 Diplomats return Foreign diplomatic missions started coming back to life in Kyiv this week, after diplomats fled the city en masse at the beginning of the conflict. The US flag was raised over the United States Embassy to mark the official resumption operations on Wednesday, while the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Thursday it would also reopen its embassy. The US and France both began sending back diplomats to Kyiv in late April. A massive aid package US lawmakers passed a bill Thursday that will send roughly $40 billion to Ukraine to pay for military and humanitarian aid, including funding that will assist Ukrainian military and national security forces, help replenish stores of US equipment sent to Ukraine and provide public health and medical support for Ukrainian refugees. US President Joseph Biden signed the aid package while he was in South Korea. Nordic developments Russia stopped sending natural gas to Finland Saturday, just days after it and Sweden applied to join NATO. Helsinki and Stockholm had, for decades, avoided joining the alliance, but cited Moscow\\'s invasion as the ultimate impetus to do so now. The two countries formally handed in their applications Wednesday. Most NATO members appear ready to support both bids, except for Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that his country \"will say no to Sweden\\'s and Finland\\'s entry into NATO,\" citing their support for the Kurdistan Workers\\' Party (PKK). The PKK seeks an independent state in Turkey and has been in an armed struggle with Ankara for decades. It has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Some experts say Erdogan may be angling for concessions or to highlight grievances Turkey wishes to bring to the attention of the international community.', summary='It is nearly three months since Russia invaded Ukraine -- a 12-week period in which Russian forces have wrought devastation on the country and its people, resulting in death on a vast scale and causing millions to flee.<div class=\"feedflare\">\\n<a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=zILBsEcfdPw:oxFvVblEGYQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=zILBsEcfdPw:oxFvVblEGYQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=zILBsEcfdPw:oxFvVblEGYQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?i=zILBsEcfdPw:oxFvVblEGYQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=zILBsEcfdPw:oxFvVblEGYQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a hr', url='https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/21/europe/ukraine-war-status-intl/index.html', image='https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220519200215-donbas-0519-super-tease.jpg', publish_date='2022-05-21 15:40:32', author='Joshua Berlinger', language='en', source_country='us', sentiment=-0.317), NewsArticle(id=20036360, title='A meandering river in eastern Ukraine is hindering both sides in the war', text='Russia still has just under 100 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) in Ukraine, according to US officials, and another 20 just over the border.

Its occupiers -- mainly Chechen fighters and the militia of the self-declared Luhansk People\\'s Republic -- inherit a wasteland. But the loss of Rubizhne does make neighboring Severodonetsk, which was a city of 100,000 people before the invasion and where 15,000 now cower in basements, more vulnerable. And if Ukrainian resistance there is no longer tenable, new defensive lines will be needed to impede a Russian advance westwards. However, the Russian offensive from the north has been much less successful. Which is where the meandering Siverskyi Donets comes into play. The river starts in Russia and flows into Ukraine, forming swamps, floodplains and oxbow lakes, cutting through chalk cliffs as it goes. In other words: a nightmare for a military assault. The Russians have tried and apparently failed to put several pontoons across the river in an effort to encircle Ukrainian troops. Satellite imagery analyzed by CNN shows at least three bridges were destroyed this week and the Russians sustained heavy losses. Further west, the Russians do appear to have crossed the river -- but it\\'s too early to tell if that\\'s in sustainable and sufficient numbers. In the last month, since occupying Izium, they have made only limited progress despite the stretched Ukrainian lines. And their strategic goal -- Sloviansk -- has defenses in depth. Ukrainians have eliminated at least two pontoon bridges near Bilohorivka in the last 24 hours, satellite and drone images show. Smoke is seen rising from the western shore of the river at one end of the bridge. On the eastern bank, craters and smoke are also seen on the eastern shore. To sustain an offensive in this area, the Russian military needs supplies, and they must come from across the border. The supply line runs from Belgorod to the Ukrainian rail hub of Kupiansk and further south. Ukrainian forces seem determined to disrupt this funnel and have made progress in retaking territory to the north and east of Kharkiv. In the first instance, this has reduced Russian fire on the city itself. And in some places Ukrainian units are now in sight of the Russian border, and have Russian supply lines within artillery range. Video geolocated by CNN showed that several top-of-the-line Russian T90M tanks were destroyed as Ukrainian units pushed east towards the Siverskyi Donets. They now control the town of Staryi Saltiv, according to a CNN team that was in the deserted town Thursday. Again the river is a natural obstacle -- and in this area it might hamper further Ukrainian progress. But the Ukrainian counter-offensive has already led the Russians to pull some units back to protect their western flank and hold as many as 20 BTGs back in Belgorod. As Mick Ryan, a former US major general puts it, the Ukrainians \"have placed Russia commanders upon the \\'horns of a dilemma\\' as they slowly deplete their combat power in the east.\" But Ryan doesn\\'t expect a more ambitious Ukrainian offensive, which would sap already stretched resources. \"The Ukrainians will probably continue their continuous \\'nibbling away\\' at the Russians to seize back their territory, rather than a general offensive on all fronts,\" he tweeted. Grainy drone video circulating on social media, geolocated and its authenticity verified by CNN, shows the aftermath of the strikes. Additional photos also taken by a drone show the Russians tried to erect a second pontoon bridge across the river, which was also blown up by the Ukrainians. The south: A very different war The picture is less dynamic in the south, where the front lines have moved little. The Russians still control a substantial belt of farmland in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, but their efforts to move further north have been sporadic. In Kherson, for example, public unrest has subsided -- partly because an estimated 45% of the region\\'s population is reported to have left. The Russians continue to launch cruise missile attacks on Odesa and other coastal regions, without much purpose beyond terrorizing the civilian population and with little \"operational design\" in military language. Any effort to attack the city from land or sea seems very implausible, especially since the sinking of Russia\\'s guided-missile cruiser, the Moskva. US intelligence discounts any imminent prospect that Russian forces would try to seize all of Ukraine\\'s coast. That would likely require a full mobilization inside Russia, a step Putin has so far not ordered. Instead, the Russians seems intent on consolidating their control over a land corridor running from the border to Crimea and trying to \"integrate\" Kherson into the \"Russian world\" by introducing Russian passports, the ruble and a puppet administration. But their proxies are ruling over areas in grim conditions, with healthcare and utilities severely impaired. And there is plenty of evidence that Russian units are treating the region as a candy store, stealing everything from tractors to museum artifacts. As yet there is no serious effort at governing.

A war of attrition looks more likely as the weapons supplied by the US and its allies tilt the balance on the battlefield. The first American howitzers on now on the front lines. The US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, said this week that \"as both Russia and Ukraine believe they can continue to make progress militarily, we do not see a viable negotiating path forward, at least in the short term.\" \"The uncertain nature of the battle, which is developing into a war of attrition, combined with the reality that Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia\\'s current conventional military capabilities, likely means the next few months could see us moving along a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory.\" Perhaps the greatest risk for Ukraine is that a war like this -- along essentially the same fronts that we see today -- would be sustainable, if tough, for Russia. However, it would hammer the Ukrainian economy, which is already expected to shrink by 45% this year, according to the World Bank. Putin could then wait for an opportunity to take a further bite out of a country that he believes has no right to exist. There is the additional risk -- if not yet evident -- that the West\\'s sense of urgency in backing Ukraine with cash and weapons might wane should the conflict settle into stagnation. Remember Syria. But the course of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine has already defied most expectations. The time is approaching when critical decisions -- or mistakes -- by either side may well influence its outcome. In the words of the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu: \"The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\"', summary='The war in Ukraine will soon be three months old. Russia\\'s forces are still well short of the minimum objectives set out by President Vladimir Putin and in many areas the front lines are beginning to look static. But after weeks of intense bombardment, the Ukrainians\\' defensive lines in the east are also degraded.<div class=\"feedflare\">\\n<a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=dmEsGE9VuM4:MBhXhNNUxY4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=dmEsGE9VuM4:MBhXhNNUxY4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=dmEsGE9VuM4:MBhXhNNUxY4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?i=dmEsGE9VuM4:MBhXhNNUxY4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=dmEsGE9VuM4:MBhXhNNUxY4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img sr', url='https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/12/europe/russia-ukraine-drone-satellite-pontoon-bridges-cmd-intl/index.html', image='https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220512152255-01-pontoon-super-tease.jpg', publish_date='2022-05-12 20:38:08', author='Tim Lister', language='en', source_country='us', sentiment=-0.115), NewsArticle(id=23799542, title=\"Days-long roadblocks, missiles and 'lots of blood.' Civilians recall terrifying attempts to escape Ukraine's cities as Russian forces tighten grip\", text='At least two convoys were marooned for days around Davydiv Brid, a village set in rolling farmland where the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia meet. One column was fired on a week ago: A man was killed and several people injured. This week, at least three people were killed and many more injured in the village when a convoy of about 100 civilian vehicles was fired on, according to witnesses. The prosecutors\\' office in nearby Kryvyi Rih told CNN that gathering evidence was difficult because the area was regularly under fire. The convoy hit this week was actually trying to enter Kherson when it was fired on. People in the convoy told CNN that many were returning to deliver medicines; others to look after family members. Some could not afford higher rents in Ukrainian-controlled areas and had decided to go home. A woman and her child arrive at an evacuation point for people fleeing Mariupol, Melitopol and surrounding towns under Russian control. Petro was one of those trying to get into Kherson. He told CNN how people had cowered by a river as \"shells flew first in one direction, then in the other direction above us.\" CNN is using only the first names of witnesses, to protect them and their families from possible retribution. The next afternoon -- on May 17 -- Petro said the column itself came under fire. \"I heard a whistling sound in the sky. We ran to the nearest barn, fell to the ground and started praying. \"When I came out of the barn, I saw that the explosions had hit a place next to our column.\" There was worse to come. Another burst of shells landed even more closely. \"Glass from the buses rained down on me, the buses themselves were slashed,\" Petro said. When he emerged, Petro found dozens of vehicles damaged, and several bodies. \"There was a Volkswagen Polo, the car was torn apart. I don\\'t know where the people from that car went. I saw two male corpses. \"Lots of blood, lots of injured people, they were screaming.\" Petro fled to a Ukrainian checkpoint, where, he said, \"there were ambulances, a lot of bloodied and bandaged people.\" Anatoliy was also in the convoy. \"During the first salvo, there were 20 to 30 people at the epicenter of the shelling. Of this number of people, only five people remained unharmed, including me,\" he said. Later, Russian soldiers came to the site and took away seven of the injured, Anatoliy said. He heard the soldiers say they would be taken to a hospital in Nova Kakhovka, about 30 miles away. Several days on the road While some people are returning to Kherson, many more are trying desperately to leave. Video on Thursday showed a column of hundreds of cars trying to get into Ukrainian-held territory south of Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian officials estimated there were 1,000 vehicles at the site by Thursday night. People often spend several days on the road trying to find a safe escape route, negotiating dozens of roadblocks, not always successfully. Daniil, who is 18, eventually did find a way out -- along with his girlfriend and their parents. But on their first attempt, he said, the Russians fired at the wheels of the cars leading the convoy and told them to turn back. The convoy included cancer patients in need of treatment, he said. For eight days in a row, Daniil said, many in the convoy tried to move north and were sent back. \"And on the eighth day we left the house at 4 a.m. and were the first in the column. And Russians let us go.\" JUST WATCHEDHarrowing allegations emerge from Russian-occupied Kherson regionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHarrowing allegations emerge from Russian-occupied Kherson region 03:43 CNN spoke to Lyudmila on Friday. By then her family of 12 were on their seventh day on the road. But they were still far from Ukrainian-controlled territory. She said she knew people had been killed and injured trying to cross the \"gray zone\" but added: \"There is no work in Kherson, our money is running out. We live on the seventh floor and we are afraid that a rocket will hit us.\" One man told CNN there were two-dozen Russian checkpoints between Kherson and Melitopol alone. He said he and his family waited three days at a checkpoint, sleeping in their car. They ultimately gave up and traveled to another area, where they spent a night at a destroyed gas station before being able to cross near Zaporizhzhia. Escaping \\'disappearances\\' and shortages Ukrainian officials estimate that about half the population of Kherson has now left the region. Some are motivated by shortages or lack of work, others by what they see as the oppressive Russian presence. Sergey, who is in his 40s, told CNN that he and his family had decided to leave as a \"pro-Russian way of life\" was being introduced. \"There are special passes they have implemented: if they don\\'t like you, they can take you away,\" he said. Daniil said he wanted to leave because he and his friends are all designers who had lost their jobs. \"And we couldn\\'t work. And none of us wanted to live in the occupation.\" He also said screaming was often heard at night in Kherson. \"And then it turns out that someone was abducted, killed, and so on. My friend was driving a car at midnight. His car was taken away. He was stripped and beaten. Convoys of drivers have attempted to leave Kherson. \"The Russians like to shoot,\" he said. \"They have nothing to do, they shoot in the air and find it funny that everyone is hiding. They also like to drive an armored personnel carrier, turn on the spotlight and shine through the windows until people leave the house.\" Mariya is now safe in Ukrainian-held territory, but she recalls recent weeks in Kherson with a shudder. \"We constantly lived in fear: There are many roadblocks around the city. They check passports and phones, especially for men.\" She had attended protests in Kherson in March. \"I went to the rallies, filmed them, posted them on Instagram. Until Russians started shooting. And we stopped going to rallies.\" The conflict was never far away, Mariya said: \"Lots of explosions -- outside the city there is Chernobaivka, where hostilities are constantly going on.\" The Russians have established a base at Chernobaivka, where there is an airfield. It has come under frequent attack by the Ukrainians.

Elena says she and her children set out on May 12. Twice they got lost. Now, she says, \"We want to wait, it\\'s scary to drive through the battle zone.\" But she is desperate to leave. \"I\\'m nervous here. People with machine guns are on the streets, explosions are heard the whole day. Citizens here are under terror. We cannot speak to each other.\" She also said there was no work -- those people who had not fled had no money. There were few doctors and a chronic shortage of medicines. \"Hospitals have run out of drip solutions. Now my father needs an operation, but the hospitals do not have the necessary medicines.\" Mariya also said there was an acute shortage of medicine. \"Volunteers started trying to deliver drugs to Kherson. One shipment was worth $7,000 -- and the Russians simply stole this cargo!\" CNN was unable to confirm that incident but heard other accounts of Russian troops pilfering from aid convoys. Ruslan said he had spent years improving his property. \"We understood that if we leave, then most likely there will be nothing left.\" His mother had refused to leave. \"It\\'s somehow easier together,\" he said. But he said he went out as little as possible, \"because they check documents, check phones. If they find something, you can get penned up in the basements. And they have some lists.\" Civilians -- plus two anxious meerkats -- endure searches and shelling as they flee Russia-occupied Kherson But, he said that \"just sitting at home all the time, waiting, emotionally, you start to go a little crazy, being in some kind of box.\" Inside Kherson there is little resistance but growing indications of dissent, with slogans spraypainted on walls and roads telling the Russians to leave in strong language. Posters have sprung up warning Russian troops they will have their throats slit at night. \"Kherson is Ukraine\" is another popular slogan, and on Friday the Ukrainian flag was briefly hoisted at the city\\'s railway station. But the Russian-appointed local government is gradually tightening its hold on all aspects of life. Ukrainian goods are disappearing from stores; checkpoints abound. The new rulers talk about federation with Crimea, introducing the ruble and allowing people to have Russian passports. Elena feels a sense of desperation, trapped in Kherson against her will, with no school for her children. \"I really want to be free!\" she told CNN. \"To any city but controlled by Ukraine! Even if the Russians shell it. I\\'m suffocating here.\"', summary='• Live updates: Russia claims it has control of Ukraine\\'s Azovstal steel plant\\n• Exclusive: Reed details surviving horrendous conditions in Russian psychiatric facility<div class=\"feedflare\">\\n<a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=fa8OI4xp32I:EEh4VbQdYxE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=fa8OI4xp32I:EEh4VbQdYxE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=fa8OI4xp32I:EEh4VbQdYxE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?i=fa8OI4xp32I:EEh4VbQdYxE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=fa8OI4xp32I:EEh4VbQdYxE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=fa8', url='https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/21/europe/kherson-ukraine-evacuations-russian-occupation-intl-cmd/index.html', image='https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220505152900-kherson-evacuees-npw-pkg-super-tease.jpeg', publish_date='2022-05-21 09:55:32', author='Tim Lister', language='en', source_country='us', sentiment=-0.503), NewsArticle(id=13745828, title=\"Russia shifts tactics, steps up pace of assault in Ukraine's east and south\", text='The Russian modus operandi seems similar regardless of location: days and sometimes weeks of heavy artillery, missile and air strikes that pulverize towns and cities, followed by the slow movement forward of armor. In Donetsk region, the Russian focus is on taking two important towns: Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, both of which were briefly held by Russian-backed separatists in 2014. Russian units are trying to push towards these centers from three directions. Advance units are probably within 10 miles of Sloviansk, and images emerged Wednesday of a road bridge southeast of the town that had been blown up -- possibly a defensive move by Ukrainian units fighting a tactical withdrawal. The Russian Ministry of Defense in its recent statements has suggested the offensive is accelerating, supported from the air. On Wednesday, it claimed 50 Ukrainian formations had been hit by its combat planes in the previous 24 hours. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in Washington says Russian tactics appear to have improved. \"Russian troops are pushing down multiple roughly parallel roads within supporting distance of one another, allowing them to bring more combat power to bear than their previous practice had supported,\" the ISW says in its latest analysis.

It\\'s as if Russian commanders have absorbed the lessons of Kyiv, when a single Russian column sat for weeks to the north of the capital. The ISW says that another factor in their advance may be that to the north of the Donbas region the Ukrainians don\\'t have fixed defensive positions, as they have had in Donetsk and Luhansk along the \"line of contact\" since 2014. Those defenses mean the Russians are still struggling, despite weeks of missile and artillery attacks, to take places like Avdiivka, near Donetsk city. As confrontation between West and Russia heats up, an end to bloodshed in Ukraine never seemed further away Similarly, the Ukrainians have held on in the city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk region, despite intense shelling witnessed by a CNN team there on Wednesday. But places like Severodonetsk and nearby Rubizhne are almost entirely ruined and at the end of long, tenuous supply lines for the Ukrainians. In turn, there are growing signs that the Ukrainians are taking aim at Russia\\'s long supply lines. There have been more unexplained \"incidents\" far behind their front lines, as fuel and ammunition depots in western Russia have suddenly exploded in the middle of the night. A fuel dump near the Ukrainian border burned in the early hours of Wednesday, just as another near Belgorod did 24 hours earlier. Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility for these events, but on Wednesday presidential adviser Myhailo Podolyak said cryptically: \"In these Russian regions, large fuel depots that provide fuel for the Russian army\\'s armored vehicles periodically burn and ammunition depots explode. For various reasons.\" These rear positions represent obvious and necessary targets for the Ukrainians to try to complicate Russia\\'s ability to sustain its ambitious offensive. The Ukrainians have also shown they can plan and execute successful counterattacks that harass Russian flanks, and they will be looking for further opportunities as the Russians try to push forward. Southern front The Russians have also stepped up the pace of military operations in the south. Over the past week, villages in the Zaporizhzhia region have seen heavy shelling, and the city of Kryvyi Rih now seems to be on the Russians\\' radar. That\\'s at least the working assumption of Ukrainian officials. The Ukrainian military\\'s Southern Command said Wednesday that Russian units were regrouping and conducting air reconnaissance as they tried to improve their tactical positions. A large area north of Mykolaiv has seen days of heavy fighting, with one Ukrainian soldier commenting on video about seeing a huge number of Russian armored personnel carriers. Within the past two days, a previously placid backwater of southwestern Ukraine has also been drawn into the conflict, after two missile attacks against the only bridge that connects it with Odesa and the rest of the country. This area is especially vulnerable given the presence of some 1,500 Russian troops in Transnistria, a breakaway region of neighboring Moldova. What to know about Transnistria, the Russian-backed statelet that Putin may be eyeing The destruction of the bridge followed two unexplained sabotage attacks in Transnistria. The Ukrainians see these incidents as planned provocations by the Russians -- a possible pretext for a move into the region to the west of the river Dniester, which borders Romania. Last week, a top Russian general said Russia intended to establish \"full control\" over southern Ukraine during the second phase of its invasion, adding that doing so would give its forces access to Transnistria. Overall, it seems that after abandoning plans to subdue Kyiv, Russian forces are trying to stretch their opponents along front lines that now run for hundreds of miles: from eastern Ukraine to the deep south. At the same time, they are hitting infrastructure far behind these front lines -- from railway power networks in western Ukraine to fuel and weapons stocks across the country. In the short term, it seems that the Russian command wants to deliver tangible results to the Kremlin in time for the Victory Day parades on May 9. In the longer term, questions remain over President Vladimir Putin\\'s ultimate goals in Ukraine. The Ukrainians will need every last piece of promised Western weaponry to withstand what is now an onslaught, as well as agile tactics to ensure units are not surrounded.', summary='The war in eastern Ukraine appears to be entering a critical phase, as Russia pours in more fighting units and Ukrainian forces try to hold lines battered by weeks of shelling and rocket fire.<div class=\"feedflare\">\\n<a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=8WxkmdL6KEc:zG5eB9YihX8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=8WxkmdL6KEc:zG5eB9YihX8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=8WxkmdL6KEc:zG5eB9YihX8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?i=8WxkmdL6KEc:zG5eB9YihX8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=8WxkmdL6KEc:zG5eB9YihX8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/', url='https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/27/europe/russia-military-analysis-south-east-ukraine-intl/index.html', image='https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220420093309-01-mariupol-russia-control-intl-super-tease.jpg', publish_date='2022-04-27 20:04:04', author='Tim Lister', language='en', source_country='us', sentiment=0.08), NewsArticle(id=2281474, title='Russia-Ukraine talks offer roadmap to a truce -- but one that passes through a minefield', text='\"Separately we discussed that during the 15 years while the bilateral talks take place there will be no military hostilities,\" he told reporters.

Both sides seemed to be in a constructive mood. Podolyak said the Russian negotiators have \"taken the treaty that outlines ways to end the war and will work out their counter proposals.\" Russian news agency TASS quoted the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, as saying that the talks were constructive. And he said that \"Russia is taking two steps towards Ukraine for de-escalation.\" The most immediate of those is the Russian declaration that hostilities against Chernihiv and in the direction of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, would be drastically reduced. Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine, has been surrounded by Russian forces and has suffered devastating destruction over the past three weeks. US intel assess \\'major\\' strategy shift by Russia as it moves some forces away from Kyiv As significantly, Medinsky said that the Ukrainian proposals were now sufficiently formulated for them to \"be presented to the President. And our appropriate response will be given.\" \"Provided that the agreement is worked on quickly and a compromise is found, the opportunity to conclude peace will become closer,\" Medinsky said -- the most upbeat assessment from a Russian official since the first round of talks at the end of February. Russian officials have previously played down any involvement in the process of Putin, saying that more needed to be negotiated before the Russian leader personally sits down for direct talks. Now, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti -- citing the Russian delegation -- spoke of the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky simultaneously with the initialing of the peace treaty by the foreign ministers of both countries. Turkish Foreign Minister, Mevlüt Cavusoglu, who brokered the talks, sketched out a possible roadmap, with the \"top priority of achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible to pave the way for a permanent political solution.\" Those \"trickier\" issues would be bumped up to the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers to \"make final adjustments to the common approach.\" And then a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would be on the agenda, he said in remarks to reporters after the talks. An outline emerges For Ukraine, security guarantees have always been a critical part of any settlement to the conflict. Gradually, President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have walked away from Ukraine\\'s past insistence that it has the right -- even the obligation -- to apply for NATO membership, as is enshrined in the Ukrainian constitution. Now a very different formulation is emerging. One member of the Ukrainian team, Davyd Arakhamia, said after the meeting to Ukrainian TV: \"We insist that this be an international treaty, signing all the guarantors of security, which will be ratified.\" That treaty would have to be ratified by parliaments in the guarantor countries, according to Ukrainian officials, who are evidently building as much insurance into the mechanism as possible. The Ukrainians also want the guarantors to include the permanent members of the UN Security Council -- Russia included. Russia says it will reduce military operations around Kyiv following talks with Ukraine The guarantees would be very specific, Arakhamia said. In the event of aggression or a military operation directed at Ukraine, \"consultations should take place within three days.\" \"After that, the guarantor countries are obliged to help us. And military aid, and the armed forces, and weapons, and the closed sky — everything that we need so much now, and we cannot get it.\" The Ukrainians are now looking at what might be called protected -- and permanent -- neutrality. Another member of the Ukrainian delegation, Oleksandr Chalyi, put it this way: \"Doing everything possible to restore Ukraine\\'s security is a key requirement. If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, which is the most fundamental requirement for us, Ukraine will in fact be in a position to fix its current status as a non-aligned and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality.\" Significantly, Chalyi went on : \"[We] will not deploy foreign military bases or military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances. Military training in our country will be conducted with the consent of our guarantor countries.\" That is and always has been at the heart of Putin\\'s demands, expressed in long speeches before he announced the start of what Putin called a \"special military operation.\" Swapping NATO for the European Union It\\'s becoming clearer that in return for forswearing the ambition of NATO membership, Ukraine expects a fast track to membership of the European Union -- which it wants to be assisted by the guarantor countries. It\\'s likely that the prospect of EU membership -- which is hugely popular among Ukrainians -- would help get an overall deal approved in the national referendum that the Ukrainian government has promised to approve neutrality with security guarantees. A far-right battalion has a key role in Ukraine\\'s resistance. Its neo-Nazi links have given Putin ammunition There is still a long way to go of course. Principles have been set out, but the detail, the sequencing and the language may be a minefield. Podolyak said: \"Undoubtedly, this treaty on security guarantees may only be signed after a ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Russian troops to their positions on February 23, 2022.\" While the Russians have agreed to reduce the operations of their forces north of Kyiv, that still leaves plenty of fighting underway: In the east, the northeast and the south. Even before he left the negotiating venue, Medinsky warned that the \"gradual de-escalation\" in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv \"does not mean a ceasefire. But he said: \"We understand that there are people in Kyiv who need to make decisions, so we do not want to expose this city to additional risk.\" And so the clock is ticking. If the talks stutter or fail, Russian forces redeploying from the north of Kyiv could reinforce those trying to make headway in the east and south. Indeed, just this weekend Ukraine\\'s military intelligence chief warned that Putin could be looking to carve Ukraine in two -- like North and South Korea. \"There is reason to believe that he is considering a \\'Korean\\' scenario for Ukraine. That is, [Russian forces] will try to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine,\" Kyrylo Budanov said Sunday. Not only is there a lot of negotiating to be done -- in the absence of a comprehensive ceasefire. There\\'s not much trust on the Ukrainian side of the Kremlin\\'s intentions. And as they never tire of saying, ultimately what happens is down to one man and one man only: Vladimir Putin.', summary='When the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met in Turkey just 19 days ago, the atmosphere was toxic -- and neither side got far beyond restating existing positions.<div class=\"feedflare\">\\n<a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=Le--6JCNDXs:_Jii_UDiwUI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=Le--6JCNDXs:_Jii_UDiwUI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=Le--6JCNDXs:_Jii_UDiwUI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?i=Le--6JCNDXs:_Jii_UDiwUI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=Le--6JCNDXs:_Jii_UDiwUI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=L', url='https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/ukraine-russia-istanbul-talks-analysis-tuesday-intl-cmd/index.html', image='https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220329095259-ukraine-russia-talks-super-tease.jpg', publish_date='2022-03-29 18:28:09', author='Tim Lister', language='en', source_country='us', sentiment=0.357), NewsArticle(id=8292254, title=\"We all realize that we will not be forgiven.'

As the flagship of Russia\\'s Black Sea fleet, the Moskva was one of its most visible assets in the Ukraine war and its loss could impact the morale of Russian troops. Tellingly, the Russian government has not acknowledged casualties in the sinking of the ship, a marked contrast to the very public discussion about the Kursk submarine disaster, which claimed the lives of 118 sailors in 2000.

The warship fiasco comes just weeks after top Russian military officials announced a shift in the focus of the invasion after their offensive appeared to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. Russia has also failed to achieve complete air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses of personnel since the start of the invasion.

Exclusive: Zelensky says world should be prepared for possibility Putin could use nuclear weapons \"We all realize that we will not be forgiven,\" she said, accusing Russia of using \"cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.\" The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has previously said it had received credible allegations that Russian armed forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas in Ukraine.

JUST WATCHEDSee CNN\\'s exclusive interview with President ZelenskyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee CNN\\'s exclusive interview with President Zelensky 04:11 Zelensky has on Friday praised the Ukrainian armed forces for repelling Russian attacks, saying they were \"doing it brilliantly.\" Zelensky has also praised the help Ukraine was getting from western countries, but has asked for more weapons to be shipped to the country. \"The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be and the sooner peace will come,\" he said. More weapons for Ukraine In another sign that the war in Ukraine is not going the way Russia has planned, Moscow has formally protested America\\'s ongoing shipment of weapons to Ukraine. It sent a diplomatic note to the State Department warning of \"unpredictable consequences\" should the support continue, according to two US officials and another source familiar with the document. Some Biden administration officials believe that the diplomatic note shows the Russians are hurting, one official said. The official explained that they believe the Russians would not have sent that message if they felt they were in a strong place on the battlefield. The note, known as a demarche, was sent earlier this week as the US administration was preparing to announce that it would be sending a new military aid package worth $800 million to the Ukrainians. The EU has also approved an additional 500 million euros for military equipment for Ukraine. Donbas, Ukraine\\'s ravaged heartland, has suffered eight years of warfare. Here\\'s why Putin wants it For the first time since Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, the US is providing Kyiv with high-power capabilities that some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago. These include Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzers and 300 more Switchblade drones. These types of weapons are designed for the type of fighting that\\'s likely to take place in the Donbas region — open terrain rather than urban and wooded areas. The US is also shipping 40,000 artillery rounds, but that amount could be expended within several days if fighting in the east grows heavier. During previous battles, Ukrainian forces fired thousands of artillery rounds in a day, a US official said Saturday. There are growing concerns about the need to get more ammunition, in particular artillery ammunition, to Ukrainian forces more rapidly, a US official said. JUST WATCHEDRetired general: This key town needs to be on everyone\\'s mind right nowReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRetired general: This key town needs to be on everyone\\'s mind right now 02:43 The Ukrainian military and regional officials have said Russian attacks have intensified in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east of the country as they prepare for a major ground offensive there. Going forward, US officials believe the likely Russia strategy is to move weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine from their current positions just north and then encircle and cut off Ukraine forces that are there, the official said. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley are conducting daily phone calls with counterparts in the region to encourage them to ship more weapons and supplies to Ukraine as soon as possible. Serhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk region military administration, has warned civilians who remain in Luhansk to leave the area. \"It is extremely dangerous to stay in the cities now. The shelling intensified,\" he said. The Ukrainian armed forces General Staff said that \"the main focus of the Russian enemy is on the regrouping and strengthening of troops\" around Slobozhansky, an area that is a short distance south of Kharkiv. In the same area, according to the General Staff, Russian forces have concentrated up to 22 battalion tactical groups around Izium. A battalion tactical group normally comprises about 1,000 troops.', summary='<div class=\"feedflare\">\\n<a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=1SExu391mdA:_Dt6oirD3HQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=1SExu391mdA:_Dt6oirD3HQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=1SExu391mdA:_Dt6oirD3HQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?i=1SExu391mdA:_Dt6oirD3HQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=1SExu391mdA:_Dt6oirD3HQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=1SExu391mdA:_Dt6oirD3HQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?i=1SExu391mdA:_Dt6oirD3HQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\\n</div>', url='https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/16/europe/russia-ukraine-war-retaliation-intl/index.html', image='https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220415125010-02-ukraine-gallery-0415-super-tease.jpg', publish_date='2022-04-16 21:02:48', author='Ivana Kottasov', language='en', source_country='us', sentiment=-0.407), NewsArticle(id=8649158, title='Russia says Mariupol surrender ultimatum rejected and threatens elimination of resistance', text='Mariupol has been under siege for more than a month, with heavy casualties and much of the city destroyed by shelling. Civilian structures have targeted including a maternity hospital and a theater where up to 1,300 people had been seeking refuge. The military governor of Ukraine\\'s Donetsk region, where Mariupol is located, said on Tuesday up to 22,000 people may have died in the city. CNN cannot verify these figures, as there are no independent casualty figures from the fighting in the city available. Though many have fled, an estimated 100,000 people still remain in Mariupol and its immediate surroundings, which are reported to be largely under Russian control. Some Ukrainian troops are also blockaded in the city, holding out against the Russian onslaught despite overwhelming odds. But they are confined to pockets of resistance, and their numbers are unclear. An aerial view taken on April 12, 2022, shows the city of Mariupol, where officials say up to 22,000 people may have died. According to Russian state media, most of the Ukrainian defenders are located in the Azovstal steel works, one of the largest such plants in Europe with a network of rail tracks and furnaces. Andriushchenko said resistance to the Russians continued beyond this plant. \"Despite the occupiers\\' desire to show that the place of hostilities is limited to the Azovstal Steel Plant, this is does not correspond with reality,\" Andriushchenko said. \"Last night there were fights on the Taganrog Street that is located five kilometers away from Azovstal.\" He said that \"during the fighting, the occupiers shelled private residential houses with heavy artillery again. The shelling of the port area also continued.\" Exclusive: Zelensky says world should be prepared for possibility Putin could use nuclear weapons On Saturday during a late-night address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zekensky called the situation in Mariupol \"inhuman\" and \"as severe as possible.\" He and his administration had been trying every day to end the siege through both military and diplomatic channels, he said. \"Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol,\" he said in the video address. In a separate article posted on the presidential website, Zelensky said he was open to talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- but negotiations would be impossible if further Russian war crimes surface. On Friday, the Russian military claimed it had made advances into Mariupol. \"The grouping of Russian troops and units of the Donetsk people\\'s militia have completely liberated Illich Steelworks from Ukrainian nationalists as a result of the offensive in Mariupol city,\" said Russian military spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov in a statement. CNN cannot independently verify that claim.

Both units have been involved in a last-ditch attempt to resist the Russian offensive. However, one of the unit commanders in Mariupol acknowledged that some Ukrainian defenders had surrendered. In a statement earlier this week, members of the Ukrainian Marines posted a video statement vowing to fight on \"until the end,\" despite being surrounded by Russian forces and running low on supplies. \"We did not give up our positions,\" the Marines said in the video. Ukrainian officials have warned of a major humanitarian emergency in Mariupol as food and water run out, with electricity and gas cut, urging the establishment of evacuation corridors to allow civilians to escape.
